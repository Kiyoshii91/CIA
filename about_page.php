                            Carl Baltazar was Born in the gritty streets of Sampaloc, Manila, Carl was raised where survival meant brains and guts.
                            His father, a former soldier turned local cop, drilled discipline into him early. 
                            But Carl wasn’t satisfied with the small-time hustle. He dreamed bigger—power, respect, influence. 
                            Straight out of high school, Carl enlisted in the Philippine Army, not for glory but for leverage.
                            His sharp mind, honed through relentless self-study and raw street smarts, fast-tracked him through 
                            officer training. Carl’s knack for strategy and his unbreakable will made him a natural leader in special ops, 
                            earning him a reputation as the cold, calculating “Ghost Commander” on the field.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Carl wasn’t just raised in Sampaloc — he owned those streets by the time he was 16. Running errands for local fixers, 
                            he learned the code: “Don’t trust words. Read actions.” After his father was gunned down in a shootout involving a dirty cop, 
                            Carl didn’t cry — he sharpened. He buried emotions and replaced them with logic and purpose.
                            When he joined the army, he didn't fit in — until they realized he could outthink entire squads. He dismantled training 
                            like chess boards, turning his CO’s simulations into joke drills.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            He specialized in urban warfare, psychological operations, and covert recon, eventually getting sent abroad for black-ops missions 
                            in the Middle East and Africa. When a mission in Somalia went south and his unit got pinned, Carl stayed behind to draw enemy 
                            fire—alone—just so his team could escape. They found him 2 days later, bloodied but alive, and surrounded by ten dead hostiles. 
                            one ever questioned his authority again.

                            Archie’s story starts in a small fishing town in Batangas. Growing up with a rough seafaring family, Archie learned early that hard
                             work and loyalty were everything. When a typhoon wiped out much of his hometown’s livelihood, Archie enlisted in the army to protect 
                             those who couldn’t protect themselves. But make no mistake—this wasn’t a sentimental choice. Archie’s a pure warrior, built like a tank 
                             with the heart of a lion. He quickly mastered combat tactics and close-quarters battle, rising through the ranks with sheer physical 
                             prowess and an iron will. His men call him “The Rock”—steadfast, dependable, unstoppable.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Archie grew up waking before dawn, hauling nets with calloused hands, listening to his lolo's war stories from World War II. But he 
                            wasn’t just a workhorse—he was a fighter. Archie was rumored to beat 100 men in total during the trouble in their town
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            He was recruited by the army straight out of a brawl during a barangay fiesta — a colonel saw him put down three men in hand-to-hand and offered
                            him a spot in basic training. Archie didn’t hesitate.In the army, he became the shield of the squad. Breacher, front-line tank, and battlefield 
                            medic. He carried injured men through bullets and fire, earning over a dozen citations for bravery. On a hostage rescue in Basilan, he took two bullets 
                            and still carried the VIP out on his back.

                            Rommel’s roots are in Cebu, where he was raised in a family with a long line of military men. From childhood, he was immersed 
                            in tales of valor and honor. But unlike most who follow the family path blindly, Rommel was a thinker and a planner. After graduating 
                            top of his class in ROTC, he joined the Philippine Army Intelligence Corps, blending his technical acumen with tactical brilliance. 
                            His specialty? Turning chaos into order—reading the enemy before they make a move. Rommel earned the nickname “The Chessmaster,” 
                            always three steps ahead, orchestrating battlefield victories that others only dreamed of.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Rommel was born in Cebu City to a family with a long military tradition, but he was always the black sheep — the quiet kid, the one
                            hacking the school system to avoid gym class. But he was dangerous behind a screen, dangerous in silence.He joined the Army Intelligence 
                            Corps not for honor, but to prove brains win wars. He mastered codebreaking, drone warfare, cyber-recon, and data-driven strategy. But he 
                            wasn’t just tech — he knew how to manipulate people. He could predict enemy movements, turn spies into double agents, and make opponents 
                            think they were winning… until they walked into his trap.One of his greatest ops involved hijacking enemy communications, feeding them false
                            intel, and making them destroy their own weapons cache — without firing a single bullet.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In 1992, When Carl and Archie were nearly ambushed in Davao, it was Rommel who intercepted the kill order, rerouted their convoy, and sent an airstrike on the ambush site.
